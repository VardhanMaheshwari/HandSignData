# Hand Sign Image Dataset<br>
This repository contains a collection of images representing various hand signs, intended for use in training machine learning models to detect and classify hand signs. The dataset is organized and labeled to facilitate easy training and testing of different machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

# Introduction<br>
This repository provides a dataset of hand sign images that can be used to train machine learning models for gesture recognition. The images are categorized based on different hand signs, which makes it easier to apply supervised learning techniques for training models.
The dataset can be useful for projects related to sign language recognition, gesture control applications, human-computer interaction, and more.

## __1. Usage__
Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-sign-dataset.git

## __2. Access the Dataset:__
The dataset is organized into directories based on hand signs. You can use these directories directly for training models using machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other framework of your choice.

## __3. Prepare Your Data:__
Depending on the model you are using, you might need to preprocess the images. This could include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

## __4. Train Your Model:__
Load the images using your preferred machine learning library, and start training your model using the hand sign images. You can use the directory names as labels for supervised learning tasks.
